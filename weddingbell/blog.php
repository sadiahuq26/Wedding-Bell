							<p>Marriage is an important and virtuous deed, and to please Allah the Ghatak do this match making job gladly. It is popular and ancient method of marriage to search for a bride and groom by the Ghatak. When the marriage took place, both the groom's party and the bride's party used to honor Ghatak Sahib. After that the distance between the elements and the people increases. The tendency to make one's own marriage decisions increases. On the other hand, the family members who used to work as Ghataks are taking less risk due to different post-marriage conditions.

									Why Wedding Bell?
								<br> 
								<br>
									Nowadays we are relying on online almost every moment of every day. This online is becoming an important part of our daily work. We are becoming more and more dependent on online because of looking at magazines, weather forecasts, paying bills, including electricity bills, communicating, transacting, exchanging documents, looking for cars on the street, shopping at home, doing office work and so on. Although this idea is new in our Bangladesh, the practice of searching for spouses online in Europe, America and even in neighboring India is not new. In exchange of small amount in a short time people can find their suitable spouses, without being deceived or dependent on anyone. WEddingBell.com has been created out of all these ideas so that you can find the right person for yourself or your child or siblings without any hassle.
								<br> 
								<br>
									1) 	Search: WeddingBell.com must find the person of your choice yourself. On the other hand, Mr. Ghatak finds out that the bride and groom just pick. 
								<br> 
								<br>
									2) Number of spouses: It is possible to see the CVs of hundreds of spouses by matching your choice. On the other hand, this number is comparatively less for Mr. Ghatak.
								<br>
								<br>
									3) Match: WeddingBell.com has an easy opportunity to view each other's information by matching the biodata and the choice. Opportunity to reconcile yourself with hundreds of couples in a moment. Mr. Ghatak can also help in this matter, but it is not possible to choose between hundreds of biodata in a moment.
								<br>
								<br>
									4) Means of communication: If you like, you can upgrade the plan and send the request directly through Biyeta.com. And both have the opportunity to send phone numbers and address messages if they like. And it is possible to get married secretly, that is, no one will be able to find out if the news of marriage is not reported on WeddingBell.com. It is usually not possible to get any means of communication without the help or permission of Mr. Ghatak. However, marriage is not possible.
								<br>
								<br>
									5) Cost: The maximum plan price in Wedding Bell is 4 thousand rupees, 9 months validity, it is possible to send communication request to 100 people. Meaning a meaningless plan. And if someone likes you, marriage is possible without spending a single penny. There are many types of Ghatak Sahebs. However, those who are professionals also have to pay a certain amount at the beginning and at the end of the marriage. And its amount can be of different types. However, it can be from 15 thousand to one lakh.
								<br>
								<br>
									6) What is the probability of being cheated: Sending a request to someone in marriage can cost a maximum of 100 taka. This money will be deducted only if the request for communication is accepted. Otherwise it will not happen. And then you have to come back if you find the information wrong by searching for the phone number and address. And the probability of being cheated on it is a maximum of 100 taka. Because no one from the marriage will try to marry you with pressure.
